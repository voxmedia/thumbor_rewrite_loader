# Contributing to a Vox Media open source project

The following guidelines should be adhered to whenever contributing to a Vox Media open source project.

## Contribution guidelines

You may send a pull request for bug fixes or small suggestions. Be specific in the pull request about what the fix does and why. For feature requests, first create an issue to start a conversation about it; clearly explain the use case for the feature that you are requesting. Be sure to review our code of conduct before contributing.

If you have questions about how to contribute or the code of conduct, please reach out to support@voxmedia.com.

## Code of conduct

We aim to make our open source work a welcoming and harassment-free community for people of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We provide this code of conduct not because we anticipate bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is a necessary part of building a respectful community space.

If you contribute to a Vox Media repository, you agree to:

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminating, or harassing behavior or speech. Harassment includes but is not limited to: violent threats or language; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, language, or jokes; unwelcome sexual attention; posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (i.e., “doxing”); as well as advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.
* Take care of each other. If you notice any violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential, send a note to support@voxmedia.com.

If any contributor engages in harassing behavior, we may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or blocking them from the repository. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact support@voxmedia.com with a concise description of your grievance.)
